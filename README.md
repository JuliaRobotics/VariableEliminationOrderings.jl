# VariableEliminationOrderings.jl
Consolidate variable elimination order interfaces and methods for use in graphical models

> Note, this is a new package that is currently under development.

# What about Licensing?

This still needs to be resolved, but one suggestion is to expand the number methods based on the user's desire for more restrictive open-source licenses.  See https://github.com/JuliaRobotics/VariableEliminationOrderings.jl/issues/1
